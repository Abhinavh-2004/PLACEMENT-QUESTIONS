## Question 1:   
**Description:**  

- You are given an array of size `n` (where `n` is always even).
- Your task is to pair up all elements of the array into exactly `n/2` pairs such that:
  - 1. **All pairs have the same sum.**
  - 2. This common sum is as **large as possible**.
- Finally, return the **sum of the products of all pairs**.
- If pairing up with equal sum is not possible then return `-1`

**Examples & Constraints:**  
- Example 1:  
  - Input: arr = [4,2,1,5]
  - We can pair `(1, 5)` and `(2, 4)`.
  - Each pair sums to `6`, which is the maximum possible equal sum.
  - Compute sum of products:

  ```
  (1*5) + (2*4) = 5 + 8 = 13
  ```

 - Output: 13

### Thought Process  

- My thought process for `q1` is to sort it and use 2pointer to solve,but I am not sure it's the correct approach.
- But it solved 13/15 test cases
